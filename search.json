Je vous invite à explorer ce package pour découvrir toutes les possibilités qu’il offre.\n\n\nOk, ça donne quoi ?\n\n\nCode\n!pip install globox\n!pip install pycocotools\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CocoDetection\nfrom globox import AnnotationSet\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nLe code ci-dessous initialise trois chemins en utilisant la bibliothèque Path de Python. Les chemins label_path et image_path pointent respectivement vers les dossiers contenant les étiquettes et les images du dataset YOLO. Ensuite, le chemin save_file est défini pour sauvegarder le fichier de sortie au format COCO. Enfin, la commande annotations = AnnotationSet.from_yolo_v7(label_path, image_folder=image_path) crée un ensemble d’annotations à partir des étiquettes YOLO et des images associées, prêt à être converti au format COCO.\n\nlabel_path = Path(\"/kaggle/input/medleaves-medicinal-plant-leaves-dataset/MedLeaves/MedLeaves/train/labels\")\nimage_path = Path(\"/kaggle/input/medleaves-medicinal-plant-leaves-dataset/MedLeaves/MedLeaves/train/images\") \n\nsave_file = Path(\"/kaggle/working/medleaves-coco.json\")\n\nannotations = AnnotationSet.from_yolo_v7(label_path, image_folder=image_path)\n\nLa commande annotations.show_stats() est utilisée pour afficher des statistiques sur l’ensemble d’annotations créé précédemment. Cette méthode fournit un résumé utile des données annotées, comme le nombre total d’images, d’annotations, et la distribution des catégories d’objets.

    "title": "How Much Memory Does Your Model Need on GPU? Let’s Find Out!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A Tool to Estimate Model Memory Usage on GPU\nHey there, fellow developers and curious minds! 🖖 Ever wondered how much juice you need to run a model on your GPU? Whether you’re knee-deep in code or just dipping your toes into the tech waters, the question of resources has likely crossed your mind.\n\nBuilding a Tool to Estimate GPU Memory Usage\nGuess what? I built a tool for that! 🎉 But hold up, before you get too excited… it only estimates the memory required to load the model onto a GPU. Yep, just that—no more, no less. If you’re itching to test it out, here’s the link.\n\n\nWhy Only Estimate GPU Memory for Loading?\nYou might be asking, “Why just the memory for loading?” Good question! It’s because to really figure out how much resources a model needs to run (whether training or inference), you actually need to run it. Yep, no shortcuts here.\nIt all depends on things like the size of your input/batch, the quality of your data (low-res images vs. high-res by eg), and a whole bunch of other factors. 🤯 Oh, and don’t forget the extra memory needed to store activations during the forward pass and gradients during the backward pass. The bigger the model, the more resources you’ll need. It’s a classic case of go big or go home!\n\n\nSo, How Do I Know How Much Memory My Model Needs?\nHere’s the deal: The memory a model uses for training is not the same as it uses for inference. Training requires more memory because it needs to store activations and gradients for backpropagation. Unfortunately, there’s no one-size-fits-all rule to tell you exactly how much memory you’ll need, but we can make an educated guess.\nYou can start by using my tool to get a minimum memory estimate for loading the model. To estimate training memory, a rough approach is to multiply that number by 10, but keep in mind this is just a ballpark figure. The exact factor can vary depending on your model architecture and batch size. To be safe, always test with different configurations to find the sweet spot.\nDuring inference, models generally require less memory and run faster compared to training, but there are exceptions. Monitoring tools like nvidia-smi can help you keep track of actual GPU usage and avoid surprises. 📊\n\n\nExample Time! 🎮\nLet’s take a practical example. I want to fine-tune the Qwen 2 model (the smallest version) on a GPU P100 with 16GB of memory on Kaggle. When I load the model onto the GPU, it takes up around 2GB of memory. Not too bad, right? But when I try to train the model, you see in the image below, it maxes out all the resources. 🚀\nAnd when it’s time for evaluation (where the model only does inference, no training), it crashes due to a lack of memory. 🤦‍♂️ Moral of the story: Even if you have the best GPU on the market, if you don’t have enough memory, you’re done for!\nIn fact, if I increase the batch size or the number of tokens per input, the training won’t even start. So be mindful of those settings when working with large models!\n\n\nV100 vs. A100 vs. Whatever GPU: What Difference Does It Make?\nSo, you might be wondering, “Does it really matter which GPU I use?” Well, the short answer is: Absolutely! 🏎️\nIt’s like traveling from Canada to France. You could either fly or bike. Pretty obvious which one gets you there faster, right? The same logic applies to GPUs—more powerful ones will get the job done quicker, especially when running large models.\nLet’s break it down:\n\nPowerful GPUs like the A100 not only handle large models better but also have extra features, like mixed-precision training, that can reduce memory usage and speed things up. They’re like the jet engines of the GPU world—fast, efficient, and capable of handling heavy workloads with ease.\nOlder or less powerful GPUs like the V100 can still do the job, but they might struggle with bigger models or more complex tasks. It’s like taking a slower flight—still gets you there, but not as fast or smoothly.\nWhatever GPU you have, just remember: You need both memory and raw power to make your model run efficiently. If your GPU isn’t powerful enough, your model might take longer to run or could even crash. And nobody wants that!\n\nSo, whether you’re eyeing the latest A100 or making do with what you’ve got, the takeaway is clear: A more powerful GPU means faster, more efficient model runs. If you need to go deeper, you can read this article too.\n\n\nAlternatives If Your Model Is Too Big\nGot a huge model with over a billion parameters? No worries, there are alternatives! You can try building a smaller model that uses fewer resources. Techniques like transfer learning, model quantization, or even using a smaller model altogether can help.\nHowever, keep in mind that these approaches might impact accuracy. Sometimes the trade-off isn’t that significant, and you can even set up safeguards for uncertain predictions, allowing the user to choose the most appropriate response. 💡\nFun fact: I’m working on a tool to anonymize text before feeding it to a large language model (LLM), and I use one of these techniques to run the model directly in the browser. Check it out here!\n\n\nTakeaways\nAlright, let’s wrap things up:\n\nEstimating exact memory requirements for your model can be tricky, but my tool can give you a good starting point.\nThe more powerful your GPU, the faster and smoother your model will run—so choose wisely!\nIf your model is too big, consider alternatives like downsizing or using techniques that reduce resource demands, though be mindful of potential accuracy trade-offs.\n\n\n\nGoodbye and Thanks!\nThanks for sticking with me through this post! I hope you found it helpful. If you have any thoughts, suggestions, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out via email or drop an issue below. I’m always open to learning and would love to hear from you.\nTake care, and happy coding! 🚀\n\n\n\n\n\n Retour au sommet"

The dataset has been divided into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data allocated for training and the remaining 30% for testing. This split ensures that we have a robust training set to build our model while retaining a sufficient portion of the data for evaluating the model’s performance.\nLet’s load the train and the test sets.\n\ndirpath = '/content/drive/MyDrive/DataSets/big_data/datasets' # specify here the path to the dataset\ntrain = pd.read_csv(dirpath + '/split/train_dataset.csv', index_col=0)\ntest = pd.read_csv(dirpath + '/split/valid_dataset.csv', index_col=0)\n\nA few statistics about our dataset.

Firstly, running the training on the entire dataset would be extremely time-consuming, even with substantial computational resources. Secondly, our dataset is unbalanced, which presents a challenge for accurate model training.\nTo address these issues, I opted for undersampling, ensuring an equal number of items from each class. This approach allows us to run our experiments more efficiently and mitigates the problem of data imbalance. Later in the notebook, we will explore the impact of the amount of data used on the model’s performance."

Recall measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all relevant instances (true positives) from the dataset and is calculated as TP/(TP + FN), where TP stands for true positives and FN stands for false negatives.\nThe custom metric, F2, is designed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance by balancing the detection of the positive class and minimizing errors. The F2 score is calculated as TP/(TP + FN + FP), where FP stands for false positives. This metric helps evaluate the model’s capacity to detect the positive class correctly while accounting for both false negatives and false positives. By considering both types of errors, the F2 metric ensures that the model is not only identifying positive instances accurately but also minimizing the incorrect classification of negative instances as positive. This balanced approach provides a more nuanced assessment of the model’s overall effectiveness.\n\n\n\nModeling\nFor simplicity’s sake, I’ll use the distill version of Camembert model here, but you’re free to use any of the models below.\n\nmodels = {\n    'bert': \"bert-base-uncased\",\n    'gpt': \"distilgpt2\",\n    'flau': \"flaubert/flaubert_base_uncased\",\n    'cmb': \"cmarkea/distilcamembert-base\",\n}\n\n\n\nFine tuning\nThe next code might look a bit confusing at first, but let’s break it down step by step.\nWhat we’re doing here is creating smaller subsets from our original training and test sets to build training, validation and test samples.\n\n# Grab the 'message' and 'target' columns from the training set and store them in X_train and y_train\nX_train, y_train = train['message'], train['target']\n\nNext, we split off a small portion of the original test set to use as our validation set. This is like keeping a small piece of pie aside before sharing the rest.\n\nX_valid_sample, X_valid, y_valid_sample, y_valid = train_test_split(test['message'], test['target'], test_size=0.95, random_state=42)\nX_valid_sample.shape, X_valid.shape, y_valid_sample.shape, y_valid.shape\n\n((9357,), (177783,), (9357,), (177783,))\n\n\nThen, we balance our training data. Imagine we have 6000 rows, and we want to make sure we have an equal number of positive and negative samples—3000 of each.\n\nX_train_sample, y_train_sample = equal_class_sampling(X_train, y_train, 6000)\n\nFinally, we take another small slice of the test set to build our final test sample. Think of this as taking a tiny bit more of that pie for a taste test.\n\n# Split the remaining validation set to create a small test sample (2% of X_valid and y_valid)\n_, X_test_sample, _, y_test_sample = train_test_split(X_valid, y_valid, test_size=0.02, random_state=42)\nX_test_sample.shape\n\n(3556,)\n\n\nBy doing this, we ensure our model has balanced and representative data for training, validation, and final testing.\nNow, we train, we validate and evaluate the model on the test set.\n\n\nCode\nhistory = {}  # Initialize an empty dictionary to store training and evaluation history.\nBATCH_SIZE = 16  # Define the batch size for data loaders.\nLEARNING_RATE = 1e-4  # Set the learning rate for the optimizer.\nweight_decay = 1e-2  # Set the weight decay (L2 regularization) for the optimizer.\nEPOCHS = 10  # Set the number of epochs for training.\n\n# Prepare the dataset dictionary with training and testing samples.\ndata = {'X_train': X_train_sample, 'y_train': y_train_sample, 'X_test': X_test_sample, 'y_test': y_test_sample}\n\n# Get the model, tokenizer, training data loader, and testing data loader.\nmodel, tokz, train_loader, test_loader = get_loader(models['cmb'], data, bs=BATCH_SIZE, use_special_pad_token=True, num_workers=8)\n\nmodel.to(device)  # Move the model to the specified device (CPU or GPU).\n\nstart_time = time.time()  # Record the start time for training.\ntrain_model(model, train_loader, test_loader, history, num_epochs=EPOCHS, lr=LEARNING_RATE, early_stopping_patience=2, weight_decay=weight_decay)  # Train the model.\nend_time = time.time()  # Record the end time for training.\nexecution_time = end_time - start_time  # Calculate the execution time for training.\n\nclear_output()  # Clear the output (useful in Jupyter notebooks to clear previous outputs).\nprint(\"Execution time:\", execution_time, \"seconds\")  # Print the execution time for training.\n\nstart_time = time.time()  # Record the start time for evaluation.\n# Evaluate the model on the validation dataset and optionally plot the training history.\nevaluate_model(tokz, model, (X_valid_sample, y_valid_sample), history, device, bs = BATCH_SIZE * 2, plot_train=True)\nend_time = time.time()  # Record the end time for evaluation.\nexecution_time = end_time - start_time  # Calculate the execution time for evaluation.\nprint(\"Execution time:\", execution_time, \"seconds\")  # Print the execution time for evaluation.\n\n\nExecution time: 363.3319444656372 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Series of graphs depicting the performance metrics of the model. The metrics include Training Loss, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F2 score for both training and testing data.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Metrics:\n  Eval Accuracy: 0.6475366036122688\n  Eval Precision: 0.23312101910828026\n  Eval Recall: 0.7605985037406484\n  Eval F2: 21.7184903868977\nExecution time: 84.7105667591095 seconds\n\n\nBased on the performance of the model on two epochs, we can make the following analysis:\n\nTraining Loss: Decreases from approximately 0.55 to 0.45, indicating improved performance during training.\nAccuracy: Shows a significant increase for training accuracy from about 0.70 to 0.78, while test accuracy slightly improves from around 0.62 to 0.64.\nPrecision: Training precision rises from about 0.75 to 0.80, whereas test precision remains almost constant at around 0.21.\nRecall: Training recall increases from 0.60 to 0.75, while test recall decreases from 0.85 to 0.70, suggesting potential overfitting.\nF2: Indicates a decline in the F2 score from approximately 21.2 to 20.2, which means that the model is not generalizing from the training data to the test data.\n\n\nTest Metrics:\n\nEval Accuracy: 0.6475, which indicates the model’s ability to correctly predict test data is moderate but lower compared to training accuracy.\nEval Precision: 0.2331, which is significantly lower than the training precision, suggesting the model struggles with false positives on the test set.\nEval Recall: 0.7606, which is relatively high and close to the training recall, showing the model still performs well in identifying most positive instances on the test set.\nEval F2: 21.7185, which remains high, indicating that despite high recall, the model struggles with false positives.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverfitting: The discrepancy between training and test precision suggests overfitting. The model performs well on the training data but struggles with generalization, leading to lower performance on unseen data.\nF2 score: The model prioritizes recall over precision. This is evident from the high recall but low precision on the test set. This behavior is further reflected in the F2 score, which is low, indicating many false positives.\n\nThis analysis suggest that there is a problem with our model, because we need a model that should perform well on unseen data with low errors.\n\n\nWhy is this important?\nWell, imagine that we will deploy our model in a real-world application. We don’t want to miss comments that might receive a response because we could use them to increase traffic on our site or social media. In that case, a model that detects positive instances well with minimal false positives is acceptable. However, our model currently has many false positives, which can be problematic.\n\n\nPractical Implications:\n\nBusiness Impact: If the model is used in an application like content moderation or customer feedback analysis, high false positives mean that many irrelevant comments would be flagged for response. This can lead to inefficient use of resources and missed opportunities to engage with truly relevant comments.\nUser Experience: In applications like spam detection, a high number of false positives can frustrate users, as legitimate messages may be incorrectly flagged as spam.\nOperational Efficiency: For customer service applications, responding to false positives wastes time and effort that could be better spent addressing genuine issues.\n\nBut, let’s try with more data in our training set to see the impact on the model performance.

    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\n\nDataset Analysis is Crucial: Always begin by analyzing your dataset. Understanding the distribution and characteristics of your data helps in making informed decisions about model training and evaluation. In scenarios with limited resources, generating more data for the underrepresented class might not be feasible. Instead, sampling equal numbers of comments from each class for the training set can help reduce bias towards the overrepresented class.\nBalanced Training, Unbalanced Validation: While balancing the training set by equal sampling is important to reduce bias, the validation set should remain unbalanced. This approach ensures that the model’s performance is evaluated in a realistic manner, reflecting its ability to generalize to the true distribution of the data.\nResource-Based Training Strategy: Define your training strategy based on the available resources. When computational power or time is limited, working with a smaller, balanced sample of the dataset is a practical approach. This allows for iterative experimentation and tuning without the overhead of processing the entire dataset.\nProblem-Specific Metrics: Choose evaluation metrics that align with your problem’s objectives. For instance, in this scenario, the F2 score (F2 = tp / (tp + 2 * fn + fp)) is used to evaluate model performance by balancing the detection of the positive class and minimizing errors.\nInitial Model Performance: After the first round of training, the F2 score indicates that the model prioritizes recall over precision. This is evidenced by the high recall but low precision on the test set.\nImpact of False Positives: High false positives can be problematic in real-world applications. They can lead to inefficient use of resources and missed opportunities to engage with truly relevant comments. This highlights the need for a balance between precision and recall.\nTraining Set Size and Generalization: Increasing the size of the training set helps the model generalize better to the test data. A larger training set reduces overfitting and enhances the model’s ability to balance precision and recall effectively. This results in improved overall performance and more reliable predictions.\nChoosing the Right Model: Select a model that is suitable for your specific problem. For instance, since the dataset consists of French text, using CamemBERT, a model specifically designed for the French language, is an appropriate choice.\nHyperparameter Tuning: Finding the optimal hyperparameters for your model is crucial and often involves extensive experimentation. Before finalizing the model, numerous combinations were tested to identify the best-performing configuration. Hyperparameter tuning is more of an art than a strict recipe, requiring intuition and experience to achieve the best results."
