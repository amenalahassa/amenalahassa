I want to share what Iâ€™ve accomplished as projects, in AI, in software engineering â€“ and maybe some other areas too. ðŸš€

## In AI
It's been a while since I started my journey into AI. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **[A web tool to anonymize text before feeding it to a large language model (LLM)](https://amenalahassa.github.io/web-anonymiser/)**: I'm working on a tool that uses techniques like transfer learning and model quantization to run a large language model directly in the browser. It's a fun project that I can't wait to complete and share with you all!

- **[A Tool to Estimate Model Memory Usage on GPU](https://huggingface.co/spaces/konradhugging/model-gpu-estimator)**: I built a tool that estimates the memory required to load a model onto a GPU. It's a handy tool for developers who want to how much resources they need to run a model on their GPU from Hugging Face for example.

and it's just the beginning! ðŸš€

## In software engineering
Before starting my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, I worked on a lot of projects in software engineering. Here are some of them that I found interesting:

- **[A blog using Vue.js](https://github.com/amenalahassa/avo-blog-frontend)**: I built a blog using Vue.js, SemanticUi, NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB. It was a fun project that helped me learn more about all these technologies. I built a frontend and a backend for this project.

- **[I tried to clone Trello ðŸ˜…](https://github.com/amenalahassa/trello-frontend)**: I tried to build a Trello clone using React and Laravel. It was a fun project that I didn't finish but I learned a lot about React and Laravel and how to setup live messaging between frontend and backend using Laravel Echo.

- **[Larangular: a Laravel and Angular project](https://github.com/amenalahassa/larangular)**: I built an invoice app using Laravel and Angular. The idea is to have a sample app where for an order, you add a list of the articles, and you generate an invoice. You can also export the invoice as a PDF. The backend is built using Laravel and all of them is under same repository. Bad practice, I know, but it was a fun project :D

- **[mytodoapp: a todo app using React](https://21amxxx.github.io/mytodosapp/)**: I built a sample todo app using React. It was my first project on my web development journey. I learned a lot about React, Git and how to deploy a React app on GitHub pages.

and a lot more you can find on my GitHub. ðŸŒŸ

## Found this interesting?
Let me know if you have any comments or ideas on how I can improve. Iâ€™m all ears! ðŸ‘‚ Iâ€™ll be updating regularly on my progress and any news, so keep an eye out for more.
Thank you for reading! ðŸ’–
