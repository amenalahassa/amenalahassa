I want to share what Iâ€™ve accomplished as projects, in AI, in software engineering â€“ and maybe some other areas too. ðŸš€ This is not an exhaustive list, but it's a start! I'll be updating this page regularly with new projects and articles, so keep an eye out for more. ðŸŒŸ
I'm also working on a few projects I won't be able to share here but I will publish some articles explaining them as soon as possible.
Stay tuned! ðŸš§

## In Progress
Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

- **[A web tool to anonymize text before feeding it to a large language model (LLM)](https://amenalahassa.github.io/web-anonymiser/)**: I'm working on a tool that uses techniques like transfer learning and model quantization to run a large language model directly in the browser. It's a fun project that I can't wait to complete and share with you all!

- **A tool for kmer base error correction in DNA sequences using DQL**: I'm developing a tool that uses Deep Q-Learning to correct errors in DNA sequences. It's a challenging project, which on I'm working with a friends, student in Bioinformatics.

- **FlapEgg**: I'm contributing to a project that uses EEG signals to control a game. It's a project of the AI club of my university, and I'm excited to see where it goes!

And there's more to come! ðŸš€

## In AI
It's been a while since I started my journey into AI. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **[A Tool to Estimate Model Memory Usage on GPU](https://huggingface.co/spaces/konradhugging/model-gpu-estimator)**: I built a tool that estimates the memory required to load a model onto a GPU. It's a handy tool for developers who want to how much resources they need to run a model on their GPU from Hugging Face for example.

- **[Graphic elements detection using Yolov8](https://github.com/amenalahassa/graphic-element-detection)**: I built a project that detects graphic elements in images using Yolov8. It was a fun class project that helped me learn more about object detection. I'm working on comparing the performances of Yolov8 and DETR on the same task. I will publish an article about it soon. Stay tuned!

- **[Bert vs Falcon on questions answering](https://github.com/amenalahassa/question-answering-incidents)**: I compared the performances of Bert and Falcon on a question-answering task. I used zero-shot promptings to evaluate Falcon on generative tasks and Bert on extractive tasks.

and it's just the beginning! ðŸš€

## In software engineering
Before starting my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, I worked on a lot of projects in software engineering. Here are some of them that I found interesting:

- **[A blog using Vue.js](https://github.com/amenalahassa/avo-blog-frontend)**: I built a blog using Vue.js, SemanticUi, NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB. It was a fun project that helped me learn more about all these technologies. I built a frontend and a backend for this project.

- **[I tried to clone Trello ðŸ˜…](https://github.com/amenalahassa/trello-frontend)**: I tried to build a Trello clone using React and Laravel. It was a fun project that I didn't finish but I learned a lot about React and Laravel and how to setup live messaging between frontend and backend using Laravel Echo.

- **[Larangular: a Laravel and Angular project](https://github.com/amenalahassa/larangular)**: I built an invoice app using Laravel and Angular. The idea is to have a sample app where for an order, you add a list of the articles, and you generate an invoice. You can also export the invoice as a PDF. The backend is built using Laravel and all of them is under same repository. Bad practice, I know, but it was a fun project :D

- **[mytodoapp: a todo app using React](https://21amxxx.github.io/mytodosapp/)**: I built a sample todo app using React. It was my first project on my web development journey. I learned a lot about React and how to build a simple app using it.

and a lot more you can find on my GitHub. ðŸŒŸ

## Found this interesting?
Let me know if you have any comments or ideas on how I can improve. Iâ€™m all ears! ðŸ‘‚ Iâ€™ll be updating regularly on my progress and any news, so keep an eye out for more.
Thank you for reading! ðŸ’–
