## Hey ! 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my humble corner of the internet. I'm thrilled to have you here! Allow me to introduce myself and give you a sneak peek into who I am, what I've done, and what I'm up to.

### What Drives Me?

I'm fueled by the endless possibilities of AI, with a keen interest in time forecasting and its applications in the finance domain. The ability to predict trends and make informed decisions fascinates me, and I'm eager to explore how AI can revolutionize financial strategies.

Moreover, I'm captivated by reinforcement learning and its potential applications in robotics and autonomous systems. The idea of teaching machines to learn from their experiences and make decisions in dynamic environments is both thrilling and challenging.

In addition, I'm intrigued by the application of deep learning to various types of data, such as audio signals, graphs, and videos. The prospect of unraveling insights from diverse datasets and applying them to real-world problems motivates me to continuously learn and grow.

While I'm still on the learning curve, my goal is to dive deep into each of these fascinating areas and integrate them into my own projects. I believe that by leveraging the power of AI, we can unlock new frontiers and drive meaningful innovation across industries.

### What's Cooking Now?

Fast forward to today, and you'll find me geeking out over AI at ULaval. Machine learning, anyone? While I'm still wrapping my head around RL and forecasting (hey, Rome wasn't built in a day!), I've already had my fair share of fun with NLP, CNNs, and other fancy models. Let's just say, I've got a knack for making data dance to my tune!

### Always Learning, Always Growing

I'm eager to broaden my horizons and am constantly on the lookout for open projects where I can contribute and sharpen my skills. Learning is a lifelong journey, and I'm here for the ride!

### When I'm Not Coding...

Beyond the digital universe, I'm just your average human with a few quirks:

- **Manga and Anime Enthusiast:** I'm a self-proclaimed connoisseur of manga and anime. If you need recommendations, I'm your go-to person! ðŸ“šðŸŽŒ
- **Basketball Admirer:** While I don't hit the courts myself, I have a profound appreciation for the sport. Go team!
- **Open-minded Explorer:** I believe in embracing diverse perspectives and constantly challenging my own beliefs. Let's keep the dialogue flowing!
- **Living in the Present:** Amidst the chaos of life, I strive to stay grounded and relish the beauty of each moment.

### What's Next on the Radar?

I've got my eyes peeled for exciting opportunities to dive into. Whether it's shaking things up with audio signals or diving deep into the world of graph networks, I'm all about chasing those "aha!" moments and having a blast along the way. Looking ahead, I'm on the lookout for opportunities to join dynamic teams where I can both learn and contribute.

So, there you have itâ€”me in a nutshell! Thanks for swinging by, and feel free to drop a message if you're up for a chat or a collaboration. Let's keep the good vibes rolling! ðŸŽ¶âœ¨
